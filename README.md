# TU Berlin Thesis Template

This thesis template is intended to get students writing their theses at the Mobile Cloud Computing chair of Technische Universit√§t Berlin up to speed.
Using LaTeX to typeset your thesis is a crucial step you can take to reduce headaches at the last minute and will make your life very comfortable (or at least as comfortable as someone writing their thesis can be...).
You can use this template as-is for your thesis as we distribute it with a permissible MIT license.
The original template was provided by Felix Moebius, and we have extended it for use by all students.
The content of our template is only for illustrative purposes and does not necessarily reflect the necessary content, detail, structure, or length of a Master's or Bachelor's thesis!

We recommend writing in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) and [LTex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=valentjn.vscode-ltex) extensions.
For help writing the content of your thesis, please refer to our [thesis tips](https://github.com/pfandzelter/thesis-tips).
